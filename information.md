I've eaten dessert virtually every night for 20 years I have never skipped dessert and I've been able to maintain a six-pack for that entire period of time I have done a lot of different diets keto stuff I've done high carb I've done low carb I've done high fat I've done intermittent fasting alternate day fasting carnivore style eating whatever the last 10 years I've pretty much eaten the exact same way be able to have business dinners be able to have drinks many of the entrepreneurs that I know who've seen me eat and been around me a long time end up adopting this and they never go back what I'm not saying is this is the most scientifically researched whatever I'm sharing what work for me if something works for you just keep doing that number one is you have to figure out what your goal is either trying to get bigger you're trying to get smaller from there you start at number seven all the way up to 21 my videographers will put it right here 7 to 21 and every three you go from Extreme Weight Loss to moderate weight loss to maintenance to moderate weight gain to extreme weight gain all you have to do is multiply your body weight so I'm going to use 200 lb as my average cuz it's easy with math so let's say I'm a 200 lb guy and I want to get leaner I'm going to go to moderate cut which is the second from the bottom here of these three which you've got 10 11 12 and I'm going to say 10 cuz it's easy math and so I'm going to multiply 200 which is my weight time 10 which is this coefficient which gives me drumble please 2,000 calories all right now if you're like doesn't it change what about my exercise and what if I have a physical job doesn't really matter if you lose too much weight too fast go to 11 you can adjust it we've got 2,000 calories great here's step three you multiply your weight 200 lb again you multiply it by one really hard math means 200 g of protein some of the science nerd are going to be like you can only metabolize 7 G per don't give a every pound of lean meat white fish ground turkey breast 964 ground beef shrimp whatever a pound is 100 g of protein so if you need 200 g you need 2 lb and that's if you exclusively ate meat I tend to eat over my 1 G per pound I like eating protein it fills me up I feel good on it that's why I do it if you don't eat as much don't now we're back to the math this is the last math equation we're going to have to do we have 2,000 calories and we know we have to eat 200 g of protein all you have to do is figure out what 2 lbs of meat you want to eat or where you want to get your 200 g of protein from and figure out how many calories are in that thing these 2 lbs of meat are both turkey I eat turkey for both meals crazy these are both 560 I know that that's 1120 that's how many calories I have of protein that I eat in my day so I subtract my calories associated with those meals from my 2,000 in this example and I would have 880 calories left over those 880 calories here's the magic of how this works you can do whatever you want with them if you need to go out to a business dinner you want to have drinks cool well cocktails probably 150 calories have two of those and have a 500 calorie meal of whatever you want because again you've already got your protein you could just stay at home and have an entire pint of ice cream that's 880 calories or each of these cookies is probably 400 calories you could have two of them and that could be your dinner it doesn't matter and mind you that's with a cut that's with me trying to lose a pretty significant amount of weight now I actually maintain cuz we're going to this third chunk right in this in this uh 13 to 15 chunk If I multiply my body weight I'm more than 200 but let's just say it's 200 for mat sake * 15 3,000 calories so I would have an extra th000 calories on top of that th000 if I did that same thing instead of having two of these cookies I could have like five of these cookies for dinner or I could have two of these bites and still have some food I eat the same breakfast and lunch every day I start my day with let's call it a 200 calorie bar you call it a brownie it doesn't matter if I'm traveling I might not have this with me and I'll grab a Quest Bar at the airport right 200 calories and 20 g of protein one of those bars and then I have a shake and this is 30 g of protein and 160 calories I'm in for 360 calories for my breakfast I got 50 gr of protein knocked down already then I go to my lunch I have a pound of turkey which we already know is 560 and I actually only eat half of one of these guys one cup of rice I now have 150 g of protein and 1140 in terms of calories that I've eaten so far mind you I have 3,000 calories to just to maintain all right not bad so now I go to dinner dinner is the big Flex meal for me now I also tend to eat a pound of protein at dinner do I need to absolutely not do I want to absolutely I love eating protein I feel good when I eat meat if you didn't let's say you were 150 lb and you'd already eaten 150 g of protein up this point your entire dinner could be whatever you want pretty cool all right as long as it equaled out to the total amount of calories you want and I do this also because then I'm full if I just eat cookies I'm usually not full this has worked for a very long time I actually had a couple of guys stop me and say dude you made this nutrition video and like like I lost 50 lbs using it like thanks so much I get a bunch of DMS about this stuff and so this is really what I eat every day some like where's your greens I have a multivitamin and I continue to stay alive and guys I've stayed away from Fitness stuff mostly because like there's all these armchair debates and like I just don't care if you want I can do a part two on how I train as an entrepreneur it's different than if you were like a pro bodybuilder or a strongman or a powerlifter Olympic lifter or just a normal gymrat I can make that a second video put in the comments if not just enjoy this one
